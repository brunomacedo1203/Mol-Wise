# 🧪 MolWise

MolWise is a modern and modular web application designed to support students, teachers, and professionals in the field of Chemistry. It provides interactive tools like a **Molar Mass Calculator** and an **Interactive Periodic Table** to make chemical data more accessible and intuitive.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔬 Molar Mass Calculator – Quickly calculate the molar mass of chemical formulas.
- 🧱 Interactive Periodic Table – Explore element properties in a responsive layout.
- 🧩 Modular Architecture – Each feature is encapsulated in its own module.
- 🌐 Built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React.
